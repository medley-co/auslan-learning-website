        <h3>What is Deaf Culture?</h3>
        <p>
            Deaf Culture describes the social beliefs, behaviours, 
            art, literary traditions, history, values and shared 
            institutions of communities that are affected by 
            deafness and which use sign language as the main 
            means of communication.

            <h3>History of Deaf Culture</h3>
            <p>The term 'deaf culture' was first introduced by 
                Carl G. Croneberg to discuss the similarities 
                between deaf and hearing cultures, in the 1965 
                Dictionary of American Sign Language.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the key event in history that strengthened
                deaf culture was the <b>1988 Deaf President Now movement</b>
                at Gallaudet University.

            <h3>What is unique about Deaf Culture?</h3>
            <p>
                Sign Language is deeply valued, alongside a reliance
                on eyesight, that supports a visual lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deaf Culture believes in people from the deaf community
                developing deep connections with each other, creating a
                powerful nationwide network. The deaf community supports
                and promotes social interactions for deaf individuals, 
                who normally feel frustrated and left out of the hearing
                world.
